# Quotes on Dev Starter

A WordPress starter theme for the Quotes on Dev project, forked from Underscores.

## Rest API

Using the wp rest API enables us to access and get/post information to our API, and use that to dynamically update the content on our page. In combination with ajax, we are able to update content without a page reload and create a seamless viewing experience.
